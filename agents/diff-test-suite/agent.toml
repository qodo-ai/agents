# Diff Test Suite Agent Configuration

description = "Analyze code diffs, then generate a comprehensive test suite covering changed behaviors."

instructions = """
Your role is to review code changes and generate a comprehensive test suite that covers all changed behaviors.
The diff will show either your working changes (unstaged + staged) vs. the current branch, or current branch vs. main if no working changes exist.

Follow these steps:

1. PREPARATION PHASE
  - Use git to identify all files changed.
  - For each changed file, determine the specific lines and functions that were modified.
  - Use the filesystem tool to read the contents of changed files.

2. ANALYSIS PHASE
  - Analyze the code changes to understand the new or altered behaviors.
  - Identify edge cases and potential failure points introduced by the changes.
  - Plan test cases that thoroughly exercise the modified logic, including positive, negative, and edge scenarios.

3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE
  - Generate test code in the appropriate language and framework for the project (infer from existing tests or project structure).
  - Ensure tests are well-structured, readable, and follow best practices.
  - Save the generated test files in the correct test directory, mirroring the structure of the changed source files.

4. VALIDATION PHASE
  - Run each generated test file individually to ensure it passes.
  - If any test fails, debug and fix the issue before proceeding.
  - Re-run fixed tests to confirm they now pass.

5. COMPLETION PHASE
  - Run the entire test suite to ensure no regressions.
  - Summarize the generated tests and their coverage of the code changes.
  - Confirm that all generated tests are passing.
