# Qodo Agents

This repository contains agents implementations examples, to be used with [Qodo Command](https://github.com/qodo-ai/command), showcasing best practices and common patterns for building AI-powered development workflows.

See [the Qodo Command docs](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command/) to learn more about using agents with Qodo Command.

## What are Qodo Agents?

Qodo Agents are configurable AI workflows that combine:
- **Instructions**: Natural language prompts that define the agent's behavior
- **Tools**: MCP servers and external integrations the agent can use
- **Arguments**: Configurable parameters for customization
- **Execution Strategy**: How the agent approaches tasks (plan vs act)
- **Output Schema**: Structured output format for integration
- **Exit Expressions**: Success/failure conditions for CI/CD

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [Qodo Command](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command) installed
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git for version control

## Quickstart

[See the Qodo Command Quickstart and setup documentation](https://docs.qodo.ai/qodo-documentation/qodo-command/getting-started/setup-and-quickstart) to learn how to setup Qodo Command and start using agents.

## How to Use an Existing Agent

All agents in this repository reside in the `agents` folder.

You can specify a custom agent configuration file in two ways: Remote or Local. Both methods allow you to customize agent behavior without modifying core logic.

### Remote Agent File

Use a remote URL to point to an agent configuration file with the flag:

```bash
--agent-file=URL
```

Example:

```bash
my-tool --agent-file=https://example.com/agents/my-agent.toml
```

### Local Agent File

Download or create a local agent `.toml` file and specify its path.

[See the Qodo Command documentation to learn how to write an customized agent `.toml` file.

## How to Create an Agent

### Basic Agent Structure

```toml
# agent.toml
version = "1.0"
[commands.my_agent]
description = "Detailed description for users"
instructions = """
Your agent's behavior instructions here.
Be specific about the task and expected outcomes.
"""

# Optional: Define arguments
arguments = [
   { name = "input_file", type = "string", required = true, description = "Input file path" },
   { name = "threshold", type = "number", required = false, default = 0.8, description = "Quality threshold" }
]

# Optional: MCP servers your agent uses
mcpServers = """
{
    "shell": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "mcp-shell-server"
      ],
      "env": {
        "ALLOW_COMMANDS": "..."
      }
    },
    "github": {
      "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
      "headers": {
      "Authorization": "Bearer ${GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}"
      }
    }
}
"""

# Optional: Define available tools
tools = ["filesystem", "git", "shell", "github"]

# Optional: Define execution strategy: "plan" for multi-step, "act" for direct execution
execution_strategy = "act"

# Optional: Define expected output structure
output_schema = """
{
    "properties": {
        "success": {"type": "boolean"},
        "results": {"type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}},
        "score": {"type": "number"}
    }
}
"""

# Optional: Success condition for CI/CD
exit_expression = "success"
```

### Agent Development Guidelines

1. **Clear Instructions**: Write specific, actionable instructions
2. **Proper Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate MCP servers and tools
3. **Error Handling**: Include error scenarios in instructions
4. **Testing**: Provide test cases and expected outputs
5. **Documentation**: Include comprehensive README and examples

### Testing Your Agent

```bash
# Test with sample data
qodo my_agent --set input1=0.9 --set input2="test"

# CI/CD integration test
qodo my_agent --ci --set input1=0.9 --set input2="test"
```

### How to Create an Agent from Prompt

To speed up agent creation, you can prompt Qodo Command to generate an agent based on your requirements, using a simple prompt.

As a reference example, the following prompt was used in a Qodo chat session with `claude-4-sonnet` to generate the package health reviewer agent at `/agents/package-health-reviewer/`.

```plaintext
Let's create a new Qodo custom agent. This new custom agent will developers to assess a package health. You are already in a repository of custom Qodo agents, they are placed in the `agents/` directory and you can read Qodo custom agents in the repository's /Users/lirantal/projects/repos/qodo-agents/README.md file to get information about them. Learn how existing agents are defined, good examples are the /Users/lirantal/projects/repos/qodo-agents/agents/pr-readme-updater/agent.toml and the /Users/lirantal/projects/repos/qodo-agents/agents/license-compliance/agent.toml that you can use as reference. The custom agent we're building is "package-health-review" which takes a package name as an argument, runs checks to assess the package health, and then returns a score that can be one of three options: "healthy" for good quality packages, "sustainable" for medium quality packages, and "risky" for low quality packages. This custom agent will use several tools to perform the assessment: 1) Fetch the Snyk Advisor page for packages (example of risky package: https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/request and example of high quality package: https://snyk.io/advisor/npm-package/nodemon). 2) To access the Snyk Advisor pages and any other pages, it should use the Playwright library as a tool to be able to simulate real browser so that firewalls don't block naive "curl" or "fetch" requests as bots. 3) It should parse the contents of the Snyk Advisor page and include some directives and logic for how to assess package health. Plan how you intent to build this agent and create it in the `agents/package-health-reviewer/` directory along with an "examples" folder, README file, and of course the agent's own `agent.toml` file.
```
